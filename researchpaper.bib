  abstract = {PurposeIBM Watson for Oncology (WFO) is a clinical decision-support computing system that provides oncologists with evidence-based treatment recommendations for a variety of cancer diagnoses. The evidence-based supported treatment recommendations are presented in three categories: Recommended, representing the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) preferred approach; For Consideration, evidence-based alternative treatments; and Not Recommended, alternative therapies that may be unacceptable. We examined the absolute concordance of treatment options with that of the recommendations of a multidisciplinary team of oncologists from Gachon University, Gil Medical Centre, Incheon, South Korea.MethodsWe enrolled 656 patients with stage II, III, and IV colon cancer between 2009 and 2016. Cases were processed using WFO and, using retrospective clinical data, outputs were compared with the actual treatment the patient received. Absolute concordance was defined as an alignment of recommendation in the Recommended MSKCC preferred-approach category. Treatment recommendations that were represented in the For Consideration category were not the focus of this study.ResultsThe absolute concordance between the WFO-derived MSKCC preferred approach and Gil Medical Centre treatment recommendations was 48.9\%. The percentage of cases found to be acceptable was 65.8\% (432 of 656) and the stage-specific concordance rate was 32.5\% for patients with stage II disease who had risk factors and 58.8\% for patients with stage III disease. Patients 70 years of age and older had a concordance rate of only 20.2\%, whereas younger patients had a concordance rate of 63.8\% (P = .0001).ConclusionThe main reasons attributed to the low concordance rate were age, reimbursement plan, omitting chemotherapy after liver resection, and not recommending biologic agents (ie, cetuximab and bevacizumab). }

  abstract  = {The explosive growth of data has led to a situation where the human brain is overloaded with more information than it can process. It is particularly dire in healthcare where critical information may be buried in the mountains of data in the Electronic Medical Record systems (EMR systems) and healthcare workers struggle to make sense of this information to provide the best care for their patients. Cognitive computing, exemplified by Watson, offers the promise of transforming EMR systems from mere data storage to intelligent systems that help physicians in providing improved patient care. When seeing a patient, a physician needs to quickly grasp the summary of the patient's medical history from the EMR to prepare for the visit and to put the patient's complaints in context. During the visit, there may be a need to supplement, confirm, and investigate the information that the patient provides with information from the EMR. These information needs can be fulfilled by a cognitive system using advanced analytics on the patient record data. Some of the ways this can happen are a problem-oriented summary of a patient record, precisely answering natural language questions about the patient record content, automatically identifying urgent abnormalities, and by providing precise causes for such abnormalities. In this cognitive computing view, an EMR is an active entity that leverages the vast knowledge of the medical sciences, drug information, and medical ontologies in the context of the patient medical records to meet the information needs of the healthcare provider.},

  abstract  = {Despite the popularity of home medical devices, serious safety concerns have been
               raised, because the use-errors of home medical devices have linked to a large number
               of fatal hazards. To resolve the problem, we introduce a cognitive assistive system
               to automatically monitor the use of home medical devices. Being able to accurately
               recognize user operations is one of the most important functionalities of the proposed
               system. However, even though various action recognition algorithms have been proposed
               in recent years, it is still unknown whether they are adequate for recognizing operations
               in using home medical devices. Since the lack of the corresponding database is the
               main reason causing the situation, at the first part of this paper, we present a database
               specially designed for studying the use of home medical devices. Then, we evaluate
               the performance of the existing approaches on the proposed database. Although using
               state-of-art approaches which have demonstrated near perfect performance in recognizing
               certain general human actions, we observe significant performance drop when applying
               it to recognize device operations. We conclude that the tiny action involved in using
               devices is one of the most important reasons leading to the performance decrease.
               To accurately recognize tiny actions, it's critical to focus on where the target action
               happens, namely the region of interest(ROI) and have more elaborate action modeling
               based on the ROI. Therefore, in the second part of this paper, we introduce a simple
               but effective approach to estimating ROI for recognizing tiny actions. The key idea
               of this method is to analyze the correlation between an action and the sub-regions
               of a frame. The estimated ROI is then used as a filter for building more accurate
               action representations. Experimental results show significant performance improvements
               over the baseline methods by using the estimated ROI for action recognition.},
